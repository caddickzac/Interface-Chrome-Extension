"Interface" is chrome extension, productivity tool, and new tab home page. I created this tool to help efficiently navigate the internet. The extension replaces the new tab windows and displays a clock and the date, which serves as a minimalist launchpad. Keyboards keys can be programmed to transport you to a bookmarked website with a single stroke. There are 62 programmable hotkeys available. Offers a customizable search engine function that can be quickly changed.
